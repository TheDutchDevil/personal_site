Hiya, I am Nathan, a PhD-TA student at the 
[Software Engineering and Technology](https://set.win.tue.nl/) 
group of the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/), under the supervision of 
[Alexander Serebrenik](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/) and [Nicole Novielli](https://collab.di.uniba.it/nicole/). 
I am interested in Human Aspects of Software Engineering, 
and I believe that we can help software engineers write better software through a better understanding of 
human aspects. 

As part of my PhD, I am studying how software engineers express emotions and sentiment and how the expression of emotions and sentiment influences Software Development. This includes understanding how researchers study emotions and sentiment in software engineering, studying the tools used to classify emotions and sentiment in text automatically, and studying how the expression of emotions and sentiment influences the practice of software engineering. 

For a complete overview of my work, please check out the list of [publications](publications) I have co-authored. 
In addition to the research into sentiment and emotions, I've also studied bots, code reviews, and continuous integration, 
error handling by Apple Swift developers. 

Background
========

In 2015 I received my bachelors in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Science,
after which I enrolled in a pre-master and master's in Computer Science and Engineering at Eindhoven
University of Technology. In May 2019 I received my masters Cum Laude (the thesis has been
awarded first place at the VERSEN master thesis awards, see [awards](awards)) and in October 2019, I started
my PhD-TA at TU/e. 

During my master's, I worked part-time as a DevOps engineer at [Spendlab Technology](https://www.spendlab.com/home). 
While there, I've worked on implementing a big-data system that can efficiently process and analyze large amounts
of payment data.
