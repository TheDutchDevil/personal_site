I'm a first year PhD-TA student at the 
[Software Engineering and Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/software-engineering-and-technology/) 
group of the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/), under the supervision of 
[Alexander Serebrenik](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/). My research interest is human aspects of Software Engineering, and currently
I'm focusing on how emotions, and more specifically, anger is expressed by open source software developers. 
Say something about publications. 

Background
========

In 2015 I received my bachelor's in Software Engineering from Fontys University of Applied Science,
after which I enrolled in a pre-master and master in Computer Science and Engineering at Eindhoven
University of Technology. In May of 2019 I received my masters Cum Laude and in October 2019 I started
my PhD-TA. 

During my masters I've worked part-time as a DevOps engineer at [Spendlab Technology](https://www.spendlab.com/home). 
While there I've worked on implementing a big-data system that can efficiently process and analyze large amounts
of payment data (Don't hesitate to contact if you're interested in internships or graduation projects). 

PhD-TA

Something about PhD and education.
